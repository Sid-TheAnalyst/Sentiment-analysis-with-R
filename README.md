The goal of this project is to practice the data cleaning, data manipulation & data visualization
techniques using R.

## About Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a process of extracting opinions that have different polarities. By polarities, we mean
positive, negative or neutral. It is also known as opinion mining and polarity detection. With the help of
sentiment analysis, you can find out the nature of opinion that is reflected in documents, websites, social
media feed, etc. Sentiment Analysis is a type of classification where the data is classified into different classes.
These classes can be binary in nature (positive or negative) or, they can have multiple classes (happy, sad,
angry, etc.).

## Skills learned/practice through this project

dataset of Jane Austenâ€™s books.
- first I have perform the data wrangling on the given dataset to make the data in the proper format for
analysis.
- After that, create the different visualizations on the sentiment scores to present the findings in the
